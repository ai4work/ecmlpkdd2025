# Call for papers
---
The job market of the 21st century poses a set of unique challenges. Automation through AI and other disruptive technologies will result in unprecedented shocks in the job market, with entire job categories disappearing while new types of jobs requiring new skills and competencies will emerge. While such shifts in the job market have happened before, the impact of the ongoing revolution may be larger and will unfold much faster than it did in the previous industrial revolutions. To mitigate the impact of this disruption, large parts of the workforce will need upskilling and retraining in a matter of years, and continuously thereafter.

The __AI4Work__ workshop aims to study how to address the challenges of this new job market by means of data-driven solutions that better enable the different actors to achieve their goals, including job seekers, employers, HR agencies, policy makers, training facilities, government agencies, and more. The challenges for which data science can make a genuine difference are numerous. For example: Workers need better job recommendations and career advice. Employers need better HR and recruitment strategies, with due consideration of ethical constraints. Policy makers need to understand how to regulate the job market to ensure efficiency, fairness, and inclusion. And so on.

__List of topics__:

This workshop aims to contribute to the scientific debate in the field of AI for talent acquisition and management. A non-exhaustive list of topics includes:
* Job market analytics.
* Job recommender systems (models and systems, explainability/transparency, actionability, fairness/bias,...).
* Applications of large language models (LLMs) to HR use cases.
* Applications of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to HR use cases.
* AI for curriculum and career advice.
* NLP for analysing, writing, and editing CVs and job adverts.
* Taxonomies and ontologies for HR data (creation and use cases).
* Knowledge graphs for HR data (creation and use cases).
* Visualisation techniques applied to HR data.
* Representation learning for HR data.
* Data-driven methods for identifying skills gaps and emerging skills.
* Data-driven methods for monitoring and enhancing job satisfaction.
* Data-driven methods for the detection of occupational hazards and burn-out.
* Ethical and legal issues in the use of AI for HR management (privacy, fairness, transparency,...).
* Inclusion of vulnerable groups in the job market.
* Privacy-preserving methods in HR management.

Contributions are solicited on methods as well as systems, on theory as well as applications, from academia as well as industry and government agencies.

## Workshop format
TBA


## Submission information
All papers will be peer-reviewed, single-blinded. We solicit submissions of different types:
1. Recent results published elsewhere.
2. Previously unpublished novel research results.
3. Previously unpublished position papers.
4. Previously unpublished concise surveys.

Authors should indicate in the submission form the type of their submission. __For submission of type 1, the previously published paper may be submitted.__ The main criteria for acceptance of these submissions are fit to the workshop scope and impact. __For submissions of types 2, 3, and 4, extended abstracts of up to 6 pages are solicited__ (excluding references and supplemental material), and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style. The main criteria for acceptance of these submissions are fit to the workshop scope, possible impact, and novelty. As the main purpose of the workshop is to stimulate discussions and interaction, maturity of the work will not be a criterion for acceptance, as long as the maturity is sufficient to stimulate a constructive discussion. All submissions must be in pdf format, written in English. __Uploading submitted manuscripts to arXiv or to other preprint repositories is allowed__ (and even encouraged), and __simultaneous submission to another conference or journal is permitted__ (subject to the constraints imposed by these venues).

By default, accepted contributions will be offered a __short (~2min) spotlight presentation__ and a place in the __poster session__. Particularly thought-provoking contributions may be offered a __longer presentation__ slot alongside a place in the poster session.

Accepted contributions will be __posted on the workshop website (unless the authors opt out)__, but will not be published in a formal proceeding. Given enough interest by the workshop participants, we plan to __organize a special issue of a leading journal__. In that case, we will issue a public call for papers, and invite high quality contributions accepted at our workshop to submit extended versions.

For accepted contributions, at least one author must register for the conference and attend the workshop to present the work.
